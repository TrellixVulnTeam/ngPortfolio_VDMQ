### Description
This is an angular project that I put together to showcase some of the projects I have done and some information about myself. All my socials are linked to the website along with contact form to be able to contact me via email.

### Technologies Used
- Angular v13+
- BootStrap v5+
- AOS

### What I learned
This was a great learning experience for deepening my knowledge with Angular and being able to learn how to implement animations. I originally was doing some animations with Angular's BrowerAnimationModel, but ended up changing some things around and used AOS instead. AOS was pretty simple to implement into the project and gives the webpage a smoother look and feel.

I also was trying to optimize this projects performance. It's amazing how much of a difference photos make in page speeds. I was originally using .png files and transferred all my images to .webp format. I also learned how to optimize SEO with meta tags and alt attributes for images, its wonderful as this helps with SEO and Accessibility
